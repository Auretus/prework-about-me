      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a secular transhumanist, a SF&amp;F enthusiast, player of games both electronic and tabletop, and an unrepentant technophile. My pronouns are he/him, and I identify as a cisgender male.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in the desert wastes of southern California some three dozen years ago, I spent my formative years striving to understand the world around me&mdash;a pursuit that has never ceased since. Migrating to Florida with my family, I adapted to the slightly cooler (though much wetter) climate only under protest. Retreating from the unblinking gaze of the daystar, I dedicated myself to intellectual pursuits, specifically ones that would allow me to stay out of the heat as much as possible.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My primary foci of interest center around technology, discovery, and playful exploration. I build computers for myself and my friends, engaging in mild-to-moderate hardware modding where needed to achieve the desired result. I have a strong interest in computer games of many sorts, with a special focus on Roleplaying games. Tabletop roleplaying games are another passion of mine, and I have both participated in and run dozens of games over the years. I greatly enjoy creative visual storytelling, and have a special passion for anime and manga. I also enjoy well-written speculative fiction, with my favorite stories being ones that serve equally well as entertainment and education.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Something that lets me bend my talents with technology toward the goal of promoting the flourishing of sapient life across the planet, across the solar system, and beyond (if I get really lucky).</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Underneath one of the primary inbound glidepaths for Orlando International Airport, close enough that trying to enjoy a nap&mdash;or even an uninterrupted conversation&mdash;in my back yard is an exercise in futility most days.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Programming is something that just clicks with me, and doing it on the web is a way to get your work in front of a lot of eyeballs in a hurry. Also, I'm betting that it will serve as a gateway to other possibilities down the line.</p>
